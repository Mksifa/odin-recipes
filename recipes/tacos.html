    I remember my mother making these potato tacos when I was growing up. We loved them! And they're great with mashed potatoes.

            Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sautee diced onions in oil until tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cooked mashed potatoes and season with salt and pepper.

            Place tortillas on a plate. Heat in microwave until pliable, 15 to 20 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1/4 cup of potato mixture in each tortilla, fold in half and secure each end with toothpicks.

            Heat oil in a skillet until shimmering. Fry each taco until crispy and golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.
